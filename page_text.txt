Jalen Alexander Hurts[1] (born August 7, 1998) is an American professional football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He began his college football career with the Alabama Crimson Tide, leading the team to consecutive College Football Playoff National Championship appearances in 2016 and 2017. Hurts spent one season as Alabama's backup quarterback in 2018, after being benched by Nick Saban during Alabama's victory in the 2017 championship game. He played his final season with the Oklahoma Sooners, also leading them to an appearance in the 2019–20 College Football Playoff.
Selected by the Eagles in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft, Hurts became their starter near the end of his rookie season. Hurts had a breakout season in 2022, leading the Eagles to their conference's top seed and an appearance in Super Bowl LVII, earning him Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors. 
In the 2024 season, Hurts led the Eagles to victory in Super Bowl LIX, winning Super Bowl MVP and becoming the first Eagles quarterback to make multiple Super Bowl appearances and the fourth black quarterback to win the Super Bowl.[2] He is also one of only four starting quarterbacks to ever win a Super Bowl and an NCAA National Championship, along with Ken Stabler, Joe Namath, and Joe Montana.[3]


Early life
Hurts was born in Houston, Texas, on August 7, 1998. He attended Channelview High School in Channelview, Texas.[4] Hurts's father, Averion, was the football coach at Channelview High School throughout his son's high school career. As a senior, he passed for 2,384 yards with 26 touchdown passes and rushed for 1,391 yards and 25 touchdowns. Hurts was a second-team all-district selection as a sophomore and was named the District 21-6A Overall MVP as a junior during his high school playing years. Throughout his high school career Hurts was rated as a four-star recruit and was ranked among the top dual-threat quarterbacks in the Class of 2016.[5] Although Texas A&M made a strong push to recruit Hurts, Hurts committed to the University of Alabama on June 5, 2015. He was recruited by Alabama's defensive line coach Bo Davis and offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin.[6]
In addition to football, Hurts participated in powerlifting. As a sophomore in high school, Hurts was squatting 500 pounds (230 kg) of weight and would eventually become regional finalist in the 198-pound weight class.[7]

College career
Alabama
Freshman season
See also: 2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team
As a true freshman for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team in 2016, Hurts competed to open the season as the starting quarterback.[8][9] Blake Barnett started the first game against the USC Trojans, but by the second game, Hurts had taken over the starting role, becoming the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Alabama in 32 years (Vince Sutton in 1984 was the last).[10][11]
Hurts produced a historic freshman season under head coach Nick Saban. He threw for 2,780 yards and 23 touchdowns with nine interceptions. His completion percentage was at 62.8 percent, and he finished the season with a quarterback rating of 139.12. He rushed for a total of 954 yards and 13 touchdowns, breaking the school single-season record for rushing yards by a quarterback, surpassing Steadman Shealy's previous record of 791 yards. He finished the 2016 season with 36 overall touchdowns breaking the previous record for touchdowns in a single season for the Crimson Tide (35) set by Blake Sims in 2014.[12] Hurts became the first quarterback coached by Nick Saban to rush for more than 11 touchdowns in a single season. He was the first player in Alabama history to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game and the first quarterback to rush for 120 yards or more in multiple games.[13]
In the Iron Bowl game against Auburn, Hurts completed 75% of his passes, which set a new Iron Bowl record.[12] Alabama concluded the 2016 regular season with a perfect 12–0 (8–0 SEC) record.[14] On November 30, 2016, Hurts was declared one of the ten finalists for the Manning Award, which is given to the nation's top college quarterback.[15] On December 3, 2016, he led his team to win the 2016 SEC Championship by a score of 54–16 over the Florida Gators and was subsequently named SEC Offensive Player of the Year, SEC Freshman of the Year, and received Freshman All-American from several publications.[16][17][18] Hurts was featured on the cover page of Sports Illustrated College Football Playoff magazine on December 6, 2016.[19] On January 9, 2017, top-seeded Alabama lost the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship against the Clemson Tigers by a score of 35–31.[20] The bowl game was played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Hurts passed and rushed for a touchdown in the loss.[21]

Sophomore season

Hurts with Alabama in 2018
In 2017, Hurts led the Tide to an 11–1 regular season record, losing 26–14 to Auburn in the regular season finale.[22] The Tide still qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed, where they played Clemson in the 2018 Sugar Bowl semifinal.[23] Hurts was the offensive MVP for the 24–6 win.[24]
Going up against the Georgia Bulldogs in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship, Alabama fell behind 13–0 at halftime, and Hurts was benched in favor of true freshman Tua Tagovailoa.[25] Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to a come-from-behind 26–23 victory in overtime.[26]
Hurts finished the 2017 season with 2,081 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns, and one interception to go along with 855 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns.[27]

Junior season
See also: 2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team
After Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to victory in the National Championship the year before, questions arose if Hurts would remain the starting quarterback for Alabama.[28] In the season opener against Louisville, Tagovailoa was the starter. Hurts came into the game in a rotation. He had 70 passing yards in the 51–14 victory.[29] Tagovailoa was officially named the starter going into the next game against Arkansas State.[30] In a backup role, Hurts earned significant playing time in the 2018 season.[31] He made ten appearances in the regular season, passing for seven touchdowns.[32]
In the 2018 SEC Championship Game, he relieved an injured Tagovailoa and led the team to a 35–28 comeback victory against Georgia.[33] Alabama moved to 13–0 and secured a spot in the College Football Playoff.[34][35]
Hurts completed his B.A. in communication and information sciences in December 2018.[1]

Oklahoma

Hurts with Oklahoma in 2019
On January 16, 2019, Hurts announced via social media that he would be transferring to the University of Oklahoma for his final year of eligibility. As a graduate transfer, he was eligible to play for the 2019 season.[36]
In his first game as a Sooner on September 1, 2019, Hurts shattered Oklahoma's single-game yardage record in a debut (previously held by Baker Mayfield when he put up 396 yards of total offense against Akron in 2015), putting up 508 yards of total offense against Houston.[37] On September 28, in a 55–14 victory over Texas Tech, he had 415 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception to go along with nine carries for 70 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[38] Hurts helped lead Oklahoma to a 7–0 start to the season. The team's first setback came against Kansas State on October 26. In the 48–41 loss, Hurts passed for 395 yards and a passing touchdown to go along with 19 carries for 96 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.[39]
Hurts helped lead Oklahoma to a Big 12 Championship and a spot in the College Football Playoff.[40] The Sooners' season ended with a 63–28 loss to LSU in the 2019 Peach Bowl.[41] Hurts recorded a successful season with the Sooners, recording 3,851 passing yards, 32 passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with 1,298 rushing yards and 20 rushing touchdowns.[42] He finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting to Joe Burrow.[43]
Hurts' improvement at Oklahoma was further reflected in his rise from a questionable NFL prospect at Alabama to earning early-round NFL Draft projections following his sole season as a Sooner.[44]
Hurts completed his M.A. in human relations in May 2023.[45]

Hurts during his rookie season with the Eagles
The Philadelphia Eagles selected Hurts 53rd overall in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft.[48] After originally being named the third-string quarterback behind Nate Sudfeld, he gained the backup position at Week 2, mainly so he could be used for quarterback runs or as a decoy.[49][50]
On December 6, 2020, Hurts relieved Carson Wentz, who was benched due to ineffective play, against the Green Bay Packers.[51] In this Week 13 matchup, Hurts threw his career first passing touchdown to Greg Ward and finished with 109 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception in the 30–16 loss.[52] On December 8, 2020, Hurts was named the starter for their Week 14 game against the New Orleans Saints.[53][54] In his first NFL start, Hurts completed 17 of 30 passing attempts for 167 passing yards and one touchdown, leading the Eagles to a 24–21 win.

In Week 17 against the Washington Football Team on Sunday Night Football, Hurts threw for 72 yards and an interception and rushed for 34 yards and two touchdowns before being benched in favor of Sudfeld during the 20–14 loss.[58] Hurts's benching drew allegations of Eagles head coach Doug Pederson attempting to deliberately lose the game;[59][60][61] Pederson was fired shortly afterwards.[62]

Hurts stiff arms a defender in 2022
With a Week 14 win over the Giants, Hurts led the Eagles to a consecutive playoff berth. A day after the win over the Bears, it was revealed that Hurts sprained his throwing shoulder, ruling him out for the Eagles' Week 16 game against the Cowboys.[80][81] Despite his injury, Hurts would help lead the Eagles to a 22–16 victory over the Giants in Week 18.[82]
Hurts finished the season with a starting record of 14–1, tying a franchise-best (with Randall Cunningham) 35 total touchdowns (22 passing, 13 rushing) to just six interceptions,[83] 3,701 passing yards, and a 101.5 quarterback rating. As a result of his play in the 2022 season, Hurts was named to his first career Pro Bowl,[84] and was a Second Team All-Pro.[85] On January 25, 2023, Hurts was named as one of the five finalists for the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, where he would eventually finish second in voting.[86][87]

On January 21, 2023, Hurts led the Eagles to a 38–7 victory over the Giants in the Divisional Round of the 2022–23 NFL playoffs.[88] In doing so, Hurts won his first playoff game, and later led the Eagles to a 31–7 win in the NFC Championship against the 49ers to advance to Super Bowl LVII and face the Kansas City Chiefs.[89] In the game, Hurts threw for 304 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 70 yards and scored three rushing touchdowns, the most rushing yards and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. His three touchdowns and a two-point conversion also tied the record for most points scored in a Super Bowl with 20. However, Hurts also lost a fumble which was returned for a touchdown by Nick Bolton in the second quarter, and attempted a Hail Mary pass on the last play of the game which fell short as the Eagles lost to the Chiefs, 38–35.[90][91][92] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[93]

2023 season
See also: 2023 Philadelphia Eagles season
On April 17, 2023, Hurts signed a five-year contract extension for $255 million ($180 million guaranteed), making him the highest paid player in NFL history, although that was surpassed just 10 days later by Lamar Jackson's contract with the Baltimore Ravens. The deal also includes a no-trade clause, the first in Eagles history.[94]
In Week 8, Hurts threw for 319 yards and four touchdowns in a 38–31 win over the Washington Commanders, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[95] In a Week 9 game against the Cowboys, Hurts scored his 33rd career rushing touchdown, surpassing Randall Cunningham for the most by a quarterback in franchise history.[96] In Week 12, Hurts achieved his 10th rushing touchdown for the season and finished with 265 total passing and rushing yards and five touchdowns in a 37–34 win over the Buffalo Bills. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to have three consecutive seasons with at least 10 rushing touchdowns each.[97] In Week 16, in a game against the Giants, Hurts scored his 15th rushing touchdown of the season, breaking the record for rushing touchdowns in a single season by a quarterback, which was previously set by Cam Newton in 2011.[98] The following week, in a game against the Cardinals, Hurts scored his 36th total touchdown of the season with a throw to wide receiver Julio Jones, breaking the franchise record held by Randall Cunningham that Hurts had tied the season prior.[99] In Week 18, Hurts suffered a dislocated middle finger against the Giants and was taken out of the game early. The following week, the Eagles lost 32–9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Buccaneers.[100] He earned Pro Bowl honors for the 2023 season.[101] Hurts ultimately finished the season with career highs in passing and rushing touchdowns, but also set career highs in interceptions and fumbles lost.[102] Hurts was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2024.[103]

2024 season: Super Bowl MVP
See also: 2024 Philadelphia Eagles season
In his season debut, Hurts led the Eagles to a 34–29 victory over the Green Bay Packers in Brazil, completing 20 of 34 passes for 278 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.[104] The following week, Hurts threw for 183 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 22–21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, adding his first rush of the season with a two-point conversion to tie the game in the fourth quarter.[105] In Week 7, Hurts guided the Eagles to a commanding 28–3 win over the Giants, scoring two one-yard rushing touchdowns and a passing touchdown.[106] On November 10, Hurts accounted for four total touchdowns—two passing and two rushing—along with one interception in a 34–6 rout of the Cowboys.[107] It marked the third time the Eagles scored over 30 points in a game and the second time they accomplished the feat against a division rival.[108]
Hurts led the Eagles to their first franchise 10-game win streak after starting 2–2 to achieving a 12–2 record, helping the Eagles clinch their fourth consecutive playoff berth in Week 14 after a 22–16 win against the Panthers.[109][110] During their 2–2 start, Hurts accumulated six touchdowns and seven turnovers, but following the bye week, he totaled 26 touchdowns and three turnovers over the course of their franchise streak.[111][112] On December 22, Hurts suffered a concussion against the Commanders in Week 16 in the first quarter and did not return, ending their win streak in the 36–33 loss as Kenny Pickett replaced him for the remainder of the game.[113] He remained in concussion protocol and missed the final two games of the regular season, but he was cleared in time for the Eagles' Wild Card Game against the Packers.[114] Hurts led the Eagles to a 22–10 win over the Packers in the Wild Card round.[115] In the Divisional Round, Hurts helped the Eagles to a 28–22 victory.[116] .
In the NFC Championship against the Commanders, Hurts tallied four touchdowns, zero turnovers, and directed the offense to a dominant 55–23 win, advancing to Super Bowl LIX.[117] In Super Bowl LIX, Hurts threw for 221 yards with two touchdowns and an interception while also rushing for 72 yards and a touchdown in the 40–22 win against the Chiefs to avenge Philadelphia's loss two years earlier in Super Bowl LVII. He was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance, becoming the third Black quarterback to earn the honor and the fourth black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[2][118] Closing out the 2024 season, Hurts successfully led Philadelphia to the playoffs in all of his first four seasons as the primary starter, receiving two Pro Bowl selections in the process.

Personal life
Hurts's parents are Pamela and Averion Hurts. Hurts has two siblings: a younger sister, Kynnedy, and an older brother, Averion, named after their father.[119] Averion was the starting quarterback for Texas Southern University. As of Hurts's freshman year, one of his parents attended his football game every week, while the other attended Averion's game.[120] On September 13, 2024, Hurts announced his engagement to his college sweetheart, Bryonna "Bry" Rivera Burrows.[121][122]
Hurts is a Baptist.[123][124] He has said, "I keep God at the center of everything. I give Him all the praise, I lean on Him all the time. And I know that everything unfolds the way it’s supposed to."[125]
On June 20, 2022, Hurts filed for a trademark for the phrase "HURTS SO GOOD." The trademark registry says that it will be used for a clothing line that includes "men's, women's and children's clothing, namely shirts, jackets, sweatshirts, pants, shorts, vests, gloves, socks, sweaters, underwear, skirts, hats and belts."[126] As of November 2024, the application is still under review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[127]
Hurts is an advocate for women in sports and employs an all-female management team, including his social media, marketing, communications, and sports agent team members.[128] In 2021, Hurts honored female empowerment and women in sports when participating in the NFL's "My Cause, My Cleats" initiative.[129]
In 2022, Hurts provided vocals on the Christmas album A Philly Special Christmas.[130]
